== Introduction

Welcome to the Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift Labs

In this lab, you will learn about:

* Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift greenfield deployment

* Upgrade from Red Hat OpenStack Platform 17.1 to Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift using the Adoption mechanism

* Update Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift environment

* Install RHOSO greenfield deployment using ArgoCD and kustomize.

* Vmware to RHOSO VM migration using Red Hat OpenStack Vmware Migration Toolkit

At the end of the demo, you will have a working OpenStack environment that you can access via the OpenStack CLI.

We will utilize YAML files, which have been pre-configured to meet the requirements of the demo environment but can be adjusted for use in your own environment to set up a small proof-of-concept environment.
